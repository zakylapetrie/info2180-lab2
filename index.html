                <h2>Web Development Tools I Love</h2>
                <p class="postdate">September 22, 2025 by Zakyla Petrie</p>

                <p>As a final-year computer science major in a web development course, I’ve come to really appreciate 
                   the tools that make learning and coding smoother. VS Code is my main editor, and I love how simple yet 
                   powerful it feels to use. For most of my projects, I just open my HTML files directly in the browser 
                   to see how they look, and that straightforward workflow works well for me. VS Code keeps everything 
                   organized, from my CSS files to my scripts, so I don’t feel overwhelmed even when assignments start piling up.</p>

                <p>Browser dev tools have also been a lifesaver, especially when debugging CSS. The Inspect feature helps me 
                   quickly see what’s wrong with my layouts, and I use the responsive design view to check how my projects look 
                   on smaller screens. When I need extra guidance, I usually turn to FreeCodeCamp and W3Schools for their clear 
                   explanations and hands-on examples, especially for HTML and CSS basics. I remember struggling with CSS grids 
                   until I followed a FreeCodeCamp tutorial that finally made things click. Together, these tools not only help 
                   me get through class projects but also give me confidence that I’m building a strong foundation for real-world 
                   web development.</p>

                <h2>Version Control with Git</h2>
                <p class="postdate">September 26, 2025 by Zakyla Petrie</p>
                <img src="Blog 2.jpg" alt="Blog image" class="blog-image right">
                <p>Git has become the industry standard for version control, which is essential to contemporary software development.  
                   Because of its capacity to monitor changes throughout a project, developers can effectively manage their work and 
                   make sure that every modification is documented and recoverable.  Git's branching and merging capabilities offer 
                   an organized method of testing out new concepts or features without jeopardizing the main codebase's stability.  
                   This lowers the risks related to code changes while simultaneously increasing productivity.</p>

                <p>Apart from its personal advantages, Git is essential for teamwork.  Teams can collaborate on a single project 
                   at the same time while keeping their workflow neat and orderly.  Developers can make sure that new code 
                   satisfies quality standards prior to integration by utilizing pull requests, reviews, and merge procedures.  
                   Additionally, Git easily integrates with platforms like GitHub and GitLab, simplifying project sharing, problem 
                   solving, and transparency.  In the end, Git is a vital tool for developers of all skill levels since it 
                   facilitates both the technical and collaborative facets of software development.</p>
